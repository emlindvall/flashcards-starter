# THE FLASHCARDS GAME

## About

Do you volunteer as Mod 2 tribute? 

Flashcards is a command line minigame designed to help aspring software developers study basic front end JavaScript theory aligned with the [Mod 2](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/) curriculum at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/). This minigame application is playable via the terminal and features 30 multiple-choice style questions related to iterator methods. After cycling through all 30 flashcards, users will receive statistics about their performance. May the odds be ever in your favor!

> - On your local machine, open the terminal using  `âŒ˜ + space` and navigate to the location you'd like the flashcards repository directory cloned to. 
> - Once you're there, run `git clone [SSH Key] [theFlashcardsGame]` via the command line.
> - Run `npm install`.

> ### Playing the game
> - When you're reading to play, open the terminal and navigate to theFlashcardsGame.
> - Run `node index.js` via the command line.

## Contributors
The structure of this application is the result of a collaboration between Em Lindvall  [GitHub](https://github.com/emlindvall) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilylindvall/) and the Turing School instructors, who provided the foundational dataset and starter implementation code.

## Context
I made this application during my time as a Mod 2 student in the [Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program](https://frontend.turing.edu/), a four- module, seven-month course focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. I began the program in January 2023, and am expected to graduate in August 2023. The application was built over the course of four days, and completed with the [Project Specification and Rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/flash-cards.html) in mind.

## Goals
The primary goals of this project was to continue growing and strengthening my understanding of Javascript code, particularly in regards to class to class interactions, as well as to practice manipulating and adding to a pre-existing dataset built by other developers. The secondary goal was to create a fully-functional application that met all of the project requirements in terms of design, usability, and DRYness. To meet these goals, I utilized test-driven development strategies to write fully-functional JavaScript implementation code, and researched new functionalities via websites like Mozilla Developer Network, Stack Overflow, and W3 along the way.
